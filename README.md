The project focuses on the design and verification of a bridge protocol that connects the AHB (Advanced Highperformance Bus) to the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology). It aims to create areliable interface between these two commonly used bus architectures. The design process includes implementing the bridgelogic in UVM, addressing critical elements such as data transfer, address mapping, and control signals. Various verificationtechniques, such as simulation and testing, are employed to ensure the bridge protocolâ€™s accuracy and reliability. The goal is to provide an efficient communication interface between AHB and APB, thereby improving interoperability in complex digital systems. The bridge unit is responsible for converting system bus transfers into APB transfers, including latching the address to maintain its validity throughout the transfer and driving data onto the APB for write operations. Additionally, the project generates a coverage report for the bridge protocol.
